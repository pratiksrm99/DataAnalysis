# SingleNotebookAnalysis

**All notebooks in this repository are Individual analysis project and all observations and insights are discussed in just a single notebook for each project**

Generally when we look for analysis projects, it has many folders and a vast structure of standard folders and files. This includes different notebooks for each feature, feature engineering, model creation, report etc. However, this repository is created to show all this steps in a single noteebook whithout losing the structure of the project. It is a work in progress and any and every comment and suggestions are welcome. Thanks:)

### [1. Website_Visitors_Data_Analysis](https://github.com/pratiksrm99/SingleNotebookAnalysis/blob/main/Website_Visitors_Data_Analysis.ipynb)
* This project consists of 4 parts which are described as Part-0 (Critical thinking), Part-1 (Descriptive Analysis), Part-2 (Prescriptive Analysis), Part-3(Prediction).
* This was done as an assignment for a company and thus dataset is not uploaded. However, some glimpse of the data is visible in the code and the dataset can be understood from the explaination given in the notebook.
* Part-0 is different from the analysis dataset and is just an example of critical thinking about a problem. The problem statement and the answer is shown in the notebook. (NOTE: The answer given is not claimed to be right. It is just my explaination of how I pursue an quick guessing problem.)
* The analysis is still in progress and more progress will be shared gradually as I complete a section or feature.
