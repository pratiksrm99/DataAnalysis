# Data Analysis

Hi all, this repository contains structured and easy to follow Data Analysis projects. Some of the projects are done as an assignment for the company and I might not be able to provide data or data source for it. However, all the steps and glimpse of data is shown in the analysis notebook for reference.

It is a work in progress and any and every comment and suggestions are welcome.
Thanks:)

### [1. Website_Visitors_Data_Analysis](https://github.com/pratiksrm99/DataAnalysis/tree/main/Website_Visitors_Data_Analysis)
* This project consists of 4 parts which are described as Part-0 (Critical thinking), Part-1 (Descriptive Analysis), Part-2 (Prescriptive Analysis), Part-3(Prediction).
* This was done as an assignment for a company and thus dataset is not uploaded. However, some glimpse of the data is visible in the code and the dataset can be understood from the explaination given in the notebook.
* Part-0 is different from the analysis dataset and is just an example of critical thinking about a problem. The problem statement and the answer is shown in the notebook. (NOTE: The answer given is not claimed to be right. It is just my explaination of how I pursue an quick guessing problem.)
* Part-1 consists of Descriptive Analysis. The notebook consists information about the data and some insights based on the demographics, time period, and visitor level. Also, some questions are answered and necessary EDA procedures are done.
* Part-2 consists of Prescriptive Analysis. It contains some question and answers for the worst and best performing regions. It gives us insights for which region to focus on.
* Part-3 consists of Prediction. It contains the implementation of ARIMA model for forecasting the future values of the website visitors based on which region and segment the user enters.
* The analysis is still in progress and more progress will be shared gradually as I complete a section or feature.
